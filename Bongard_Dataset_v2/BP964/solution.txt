Bongard Problems such that making repeated small changes can switch an example's sorting vs. Bongard Problems in which the two sides are so different that it is impossible to cross the gap by making successive small changes to examples while staying within the class of examples sorted by the Bongard Problem (there is no middle-ground between the sides; there is no obvious choice of shared ambient context both sides are part of).
