## 1. Introduction
In this project whose name is G_W23_Large_Multimodal_Model_for_Solving_Bongard_Puzzles.We mainly focus on Bongard Puzzles.A Bongard problem is a kind of puzzle invented by the Soviet computer scientist Mikhail Bongard (1924–1971), probably in the mid-1960s.It consist two set of images.The task is to get two feature of each other.These two features are the same in the first set and different in the second set.We train and use AI models to solve these puzzles and give solutions.
## 2.Literature sueveys
Lists of the AI models we use to generate the solution of Bongard Puzzles and Bongard Puzzles in the form of images.We will test and use more AI models.
### 2.1 Chatgpt 
Below is a simple image generated by Chatgpt
![Chatgpt](https://i.imgur.com/m6yzS34.png)
#### Advantage
We can use it to generate the solution of Bongard Puzzles.
#### Disadvantage
It still generate some simple images.Our main task is to solve medium difficulty Bongard Puzzles.
### 2.2 Janus Pro
Below is a simple image generated by Janus Pro

#### Advantage
We can use it to generate the solution of Bongard Puzzles and seem it's more difficult than Chatgpt.
#### Disadvantage
It still generate some simple images instead of images of medium difficulty Bongard Puzzles as we want.
### 2.3 There are more AI models in the furture...
